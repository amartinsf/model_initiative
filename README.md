## Introduction

This document aims to describe how to use matlab/octave and/or python to launch auditory pathway
models and detectors in the context of a model comparison framework described in more details below.

A: Classic experiment in psychoacoustics B: Structure of the model comparison framework, models process
sounds output by the experiment side.The modelâ€™s output is then fed to the detector which comes up with a decision/

From the figure below, two sides can be observed: the experiment side and the model/detector side/

## Launching the experiment side
Launching the experiment side requires a couple of matlab toolboxes:
* the AFC toolbox can be found at: http://medi.uni-oldenburg.de/afc/
* the AMT toolbox development version can be found at: https://sourceforge.net/p/amtoolbox/code/ci/master/tree/
* the binaural cross-correlogram toolbox by Michael Akeroyd (not currently available but also not manda-
tory to run most experiments)
