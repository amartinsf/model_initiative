This is a quick description of how to operate the model framework in case both experiment and model are in Matlab

1. start Matlab
2. run model_initiative_init_experiment
3. run experiment (make sure your experiment software is correctly configured i.e. paths have been set)

4. start 2nd Matlab
5. run model_initiative_init_model
6. run model_server and specify the model function call and decision stage function call

7. wait...programs running
8. data will be stored as specified in the experiment function. Ideally in the model_initative\data folder.
9. View/plot/analyze ideally using the first "experiment" Matlab
