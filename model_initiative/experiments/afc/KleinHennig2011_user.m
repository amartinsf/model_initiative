% example_user - stimulus generation function of experiment 'example' -
%
% This function is called by afc_main when starting
% the experiment 'example'. It generates the stimuli which
% are presented during the experiment.
% The stimuli must be elements of the structure 'work' as follows:
%
% work.signal = def.intervallen by 2 times def.intervalnum matrix.
%               The first two columns must contain the test signal
%               (column 1 = left, column 2 = right) ...
% 
% work.presig = def.presiglen by 2 matrix.
%               The pre-signal. 
%               (column 1 = left, column 2 = right).
%
% work.postsig = def.postsiglen by 2 matrix.
%                The post-signal. 
%               ( column 1 = left, column 2 = right).
%
% work.pausesig = def.pausesiglen by 2 matrix.
%                 The pause-signal. 
%                 (column 1 = left, column 2 = right).
% 
% To design an own experiment, e.g., 'myexperiment',
% make changes in this file and save it as 'myexperiment_user.m'.
% Ensure that the referenced elements of structure 'work' are existing.
