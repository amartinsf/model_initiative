This is a quick description of how to run a simple N_0 S_pi (3-AFC constant stimulus) example

1. start Matlab
2. run model_initiative_init_experiment
3. run N0Spi_example;

4. start 2nd Matlab
5. run model_initiative_init_model
6. run model_server(3,'super_simple_EI(wave,0.01)','largest_residual(pathway_out)',0)

7. data will be stored in model_initative\data folder.
